{"_id":"2RYQwWDaOIkS0wZp","name":"Inn: The Fallen Tower","content":"<h2>Inn: The Fallen Tower  ★★★  $$$$</h2>\n<p>Jedes’s only inn gets its name from the fall of the keep about 120 years ago. The sign above the door shows a tower collapsing into a river. Stone reclaimed from the ruined keep was used to build the inn, which was extended twenty-five years ago. The Fallen Tower sees a huge difference in trade over the year; by far the busiest time is during the horse fair.</p>\n<p>The innkeeper, Jastrin of Dyrl, is in his mid thirties. He is easy-going and hard-working, with a remarkable memory for names and faces. Jastrin is the guildmaster of Asolade, but as there are only three inns, and no taverns, in the hundred this is not an onerous task.</p>\n<p>Jastrin’s wife, Shalya, is ten years his junior. She is friendly and gregarious with long black hair and pale, freckled skin. Shalya and Jastrin have three young children, all of whom work in the kitchen with their mother.</p>\n<p>Jastrin employs a journeyman, 22-year-old Halir of Densar, who lusts after Shalya. Halir has mistaken her open friendship for sexual interest. Jastrin’s only other full-time employee is 15-year-old Ealfric of Lysten, son of the innkeeper of Yeashim. Ealfric is nervous and shy—not the best traits for an innkeeper. The locals take every opportunity to embarrass him.</p>\n<p>During the fair Jastrin usually takes on three or four additional members of staff, usually the wives of local freemen. Jastrin always tries to employ mature women rather than young girls.</p>\n<p>The guildmaster brews and sells: Haniale, a traditional piney, nut brown ale common across Kaldor; Jastrin’s Dark, a dark mild beer; and Asolade Perry, made to his own recipe from local pears. Jastrin also distils a strong pear liqueur. He buys imported wines and mead at the beginning of the horse fair, and charges premium prices for them. Whatever remains after the fair is usually heavily discounted, as locals rarely buy “foreign” drinks. Jastrin charges standard prices (¼d per pint) for his ale, beer, and perry. His measures, however, are always short; he can sell nine of his pints from a true gallon. Jastrin himself drinks only sparingly.</p>\n<p>Food provided at the inn—locally caught trout and sometimes other fish, local sausages, ham, and bacon—is usually of a reasonable quality. During the horse fair there is always a pig roasting on a spit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.kooluWy1dozULyxb]{Fallen Tower Inn - Common Room}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.pjCeT4W7q3I5myq6]{Fallen Tower Inn - Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.xIALeUMIzVIpP2sE]{Fallen Tower Inn - Staff Quarters}</li>\n</ul>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gJdONrabJ2SyRfYT":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":3800000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.7ocKjg4sObVKLBPg"}}}

He stands a couple of inches under six feet in height and is slightly overweight. His once dark hair is now grey at the temples.</p>\n<p>The constable is an old and trusted friend of the Earl Dariune. They met in 682, when the young Troda was fostered at the court of King Torastra at Olokand and Shernath’s father was a member of the king’s guard. The two have been firm friends ever since.</p>\n<p>Upon receiving his knighthood, Shernath became a household retainer in the service of Troda’s father, Earl Scina Dariune, at Kiban. Sir Shernath impressed his new lord and, in 702, was rewarded with the post of constable of Jedes, made vacant by the death of Sir Duns Doulzarn.</p>\n<p>Sir Shernath is a careful, conscientious administrator who, importantly, knows when to delegate. He reputedly shows no favours, but appoints the best man, or woman, to the job. Many local clans would, however, dispute this, as they have seen lucrative posts handed to relatives of the constable and his wife. Nevertheless, incompetence will usually lead to swift dismissal. Sir Shernath delivers his feudal dues, and often more, on time, keeps the local yeomen well-trained, and has improved the Kolorn and Hutop roads. Earl Troda values his friend very highly.</p>\n<p>The earl and his constable meet only two or three times a year. The earl confides in his friend and can rely on him to give an honest opinion, regardless of the earl’s feelings. While the men never argue, they are often blunt to the point of rudeness. Some of Earl Troda’s vassal’s, after witnessing such discussions, assume Sir Shernath’s position is less secure than it actually is.</p>\n<p>In addition to managing the earl’s lands in Asolade, Sir Shernath is often given other tasks. He is currently working on an estimate of expected revenues from Kyg, as the earl is concerned about his income from that part of his holdings. Sir Shernath has been sent copies of the revenues and receipts that the Constable of Kyg sent to Kiban. He suspects that his liege is being swindled, but as yet lacks any proof. He intends to send a small group of trusted investigators to Kyg.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/hm-loc-jedes/assets/images/sir-shernath-mirdarne.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gJdONrabJ2SyRfYT":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":1000000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.Hwn3HhcUuCpb0CY0"}},"_id":"4IO6dkrOW3kVnCaC"}

The noble ladies retire to the solar or take the air. The constable’s staff begin their duties. The main meal of the day usually begins before noon. After the meal work continues until a little before dusk, when supper is prepared. Most folk retire soon after dusk.</p>\n<h2>Guard Duties</h2>\n<p>The men-at-arms have a strict rotation of duties. The drawbridge is open from dawn until dusk, and a guard patrols between the drawbridge and the postern gate during this time. A guard is always on duty in the small hall, regardless of the time of day. Similarly, there is always a guard on the battlements. When one manus is on duty within the keep, the other is on patrol across the hundred.</p>\n<h2>Monthly Routine</h2>\n<p>Sir Shernath holds his vassals’ court on the 12th of each month. The court is open to the manor lords and bailiffs holding fealty from Earl Troda Dariune, any freemen in these holdings, and all residents of Jedes. On the 25th of each month Sir Shernath holds a feast for his vassals. The lords of Andrake, Bory, Feneven, and Yalen regularly attend, as do the bailiffs of Belgie, Calsite, Skaist, and Tamorlan. The new bailiff of Chewintin is yet to attend. The constable also invites the Pelnala of Bromeleon, the hundred bailiff, and the Miner’s Guild masters. Only the hundred bailiff attends with any regularity. This feast occurs on the last Soratir of the month. The nobles who attend the feast also attend the Laranian mass, making this the best-attended Soratir each month.</p>\n<h2>Seasonal Events</h2>\n<p>On the fourth day of each season the constable holds a feast for the Council of the Mangai of Asolade Hundred.

Even travelling by horse, this is a considerable distance, an hour’s ride and close to two hours’ walk. Nevertheless, some lesser nobles choose to stay at these inns rather than camp on the common. However, these inns see most of their trade in the days leading up to the fair.</li>\n<li><strong>17 Halane:</strong> Blood-day. This is the traditional day for slaughtering animals before the winter. A feast for all villagers is held on the Castle field, or in the keep if the weather is inclement.</li>\n<li><strong>10–15 Savor:</strong> St. Bromel’s Fast. Jedes is usually busy five days before the fast and five days after. During the fast days the pilgrims are at Bromeleon, and Jedes is quiet.

Within the keep the constable is armed only with a dagger. When visiting the local fiefs, he usually carries a fine Kuzhan broadsword, a present from Earl Troda.</p>\n<p>The constable keeps copies of every report he has sent to Earl Troda in a locked chest in this room. Only his wife is aware of this. On occasion, Sir Shernath has allowed servants to see him opening and emptying the chest, so that everyone in the keep knows that the chest contains “some old papers”, and not “valuable treasure”. To the earl’s enemies, of course, the contents of the chest are valuable treasure indeed.</p>\n<h3>2 The Royal Chamber</h3>\n<p>This well-appointed and lavishly furnished room is used by Earl Troda or King Miginath on their infrequent visits to Jedes. The royal chamber is cleaned regularly. If an important guest arrives unexpectedly, Sir Shernath is always ready to host them. Other than the king and the earl, the only other person to have regularly used this room over the years is the late sheriff of Osel, Prince Merik Elendsa.

{"name":"Keep: The Great Hall","content":"<h2>The Great Hall</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The great hall is huge but simply decorated. Thick red velvet curtains hang alongside the windows. They are closed only in the winter months, to reduce draughts. A huge shield bearing the blazon of Earl Dariune, actually a six-foot-high wooden frame with embroidered cloth stretched over it, hangs on the wall high above the fireplace.</p>\n<p>The blazons of the local landholding clans—Doulzarn, Ercamber, Erwyne, Mazerony, Orteyan, Poulty, and Vaen—hang along the curved northern wall. The arms of the bailiff clans—Halgalen, Kaphin, and Lartyne— hang from the balcony. The wooden shield bearing the arms of Lartyne was freshly painted over the winter, Sir Krisagon having only recently arrived in Chewintin, and it stands out from the others. Clan Mirdarne’s blazon hangs from the central pillar. The sole blazon on the wall opposite the fireplace is that of Sir Laban of Tyart, winner of last year’s tourney. All of these blazons are painted onto wooden knight shields.</p>\n<p>The great hall is an echoing, empty room. The keep’s residents, including the bonded masters and the garrison, eat two meals a day here. For most of the year the ladies eat with the men. Their presence makes for forty or more folk, filling seven or eight tables, a number easily accommodated within the hall. During the Horse Fair and Tourney the ladies dine on the gallery.</p>\n<p>The head chambermaid, Cralla of Aven, the 21year-old daughter of the cook, sleeps in the great hall along with six other chambermaids, all women from Jedes and the surrounding villages. Two scribes, Torbris and Eldaen of Aphria, and two apprentice clothiers also sleep here. Four other servants, Elarit of Veris and her daughters, live in a cottage in the village.</p>\n<p>Cralla is fastidious about her work. She is usually quiet and reserved, but she pours scorn on the man-at-arms Padrig of Lunn, who is conducting affairs with two of the young chambermaids. The two maids, Brenna of Selis and Yritha of Tannis, vie for his affections. Both giggle and flirt when he approaches. Cralla was Padrig’s first conquest when he arrived at the keep. She was dumped two years ago for a prettier girl and now hates her former lover with a venom.</p>\n<p><img style=\"float:left;width:194;margin-right:8px\" src=\"modules/hm-loc-jedes/assets/images/miginaths-chair.webp\" /></p>\n<p>The hall is furnished with simple trestle tables and benches, all made from local timber. The tables can be moved to one side to provide accommodation for visitors. As the king always brings a large retinue to Jedes, a great many knights are quartered here during the annual horse fair and tourney.</p>\n<p>There are three ornately carved chairs in the room. One chair, carved with Jarin knotwork, is used by Sir Shernath; a second, carved with hunting scenes, is used by Sir Tamys. The third, which is kept next to the fireplace and covered with an embroidered blanket, is ornately carved with dragons and wyverns and made from Byrian dark hardwood. This chair was a present to King Miginath from Lady Erila Kaphin, and reserved exclusively for his use; Sir Shernath is its guardian. The constable recently had one of the servant girls, Brenna of Selis, whipped and placed in the oubliette for four days because she sat in it when she thought that noone was looking. Brenna still has nightmares about the experience.

On the wall between the two windows hangs the remains of a broken jousting pole, around which is tied a faded silk ribbon. Lady Helarn found it in her husband’s effects after he died, and recognised it as the favour she gave him when they first met at Dagrath’s Fair. Other than this one item, the walls are unadorned. Lady Helarn insists that Cralla clean this room, not one of “those giddy young things”. The chancellor often works in her room, and by talking with Cralla she can pick up servants’ gossip, which she occasionally passes on to Sir Shernath.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.Fe3bC4oPMid9LkFY]{NPC: Lady Helarn Poulty, Chancellor of the Keep}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4 The Chaplain</h3>\n<p>There is no doubting that this room is occupied by a priest.

{"_id":"QVUhr7Z5Z4l7WqAB","name":"Military","content":"<h1>Military</h1>\n<div>\n<p>The Jedes permanent garrison consists of a squadron of light horse and a decad of medium foot. This unusual arrangement (most keeps are garrisoned by a company of footmen) is due to the prevelance of horsemen in the Hundred. The guard wear distinctive blazoned surcoats. The badge, formerly just the thistle of Clan Dariune, was amended ten years ago following the constable’s suggestion to the earl to include an unadorned helm. As Sir Shernath’s blazon incorporates three helms, this was correctly taken by most of the locals as a signal that the new constable had the earl’s full support.</p>\n<h2>The Ten-Day Muster</h2>\n<p>In addition to their normal feudal duties, all yeomen in the manors under Sir Shernath’s control must arrive in Jedes no later than dusk on 21 Kelen. The next three days are spent in drills, before the fair commences on the 25th. The yeomen are free to return home on 1 Nolus.</p>\n<p>During this ten-day muster the yeomen are incorporated into the standing forces at Jedes, giving a force of one (full strength) decad of light foot, three decads (twentytwo men) of medium foot, two decads (fourteen men) of archers, and two squadrons (seventeen men) of light horse.</p>\n<p>During the ten-day muster five years ago, a band of a dozen outlaws took the opportunity to raid Mowich. The tourney was delayed as some forty men-at-arms and a similar number of knights took part in a manhunt. The outlaws scattered but eight were tracked down.

The members of the squadron, each a skilled and experienced rider, are mainly drawn from the local families of light horse yeomen. The squadron pride themselves on the speed and precision of their riding. They are used as messengers; any one of the riders can reach Kiban in less than two days.</p>\n<p>The constable insists on uniform equipment for his troops. The light horse squadron are issued with a quilt cowl, a studded leather halfhelm, a quilt longsleeved aketon, leather riding breeches, calf boots, and riding gloves, and a cloth surcoat blazoned with the helm and thistle. They all carry spear, shortsword, and roundshield.</p>\n<p>The mani have a fixed roster of duties, which they both swap every five days. One manus patrols the hundred. Their orders are to visit all of the earl’s holdings, but they often turn back at Gemheldon without visiting Chewintin or Keldkith, as they have never been made welcome there. Lieutenant Blyra has only recently become aware of this and intends to make visits to Chewintin mandatory. The patrol visits Bromeleon but, like most residents of the hundred, avoids Poynter. The troop also checks on the two mines; the Miner’s Guild has a contract with the constable to provide guards, a duty that the light horse undertake.</p>\n<h3>The First Manus</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Molarin (sergeant) Chastyn of Arwyn</strong> is the senior NCO of the squadron.

The apprentices despise him, as Erdar likes to “make sure they know who is in charge” when his father is absent.

It is not unusual for visitors from Chybisa, the Thardic Republic, and even Kanday to attend the horse fair in search of a fine warhorse or palfrey. Iriel keeps an astonishingly complex record of the bloodline of his horses in a locked chest in his bedroom. His records now cover over forty years of breeding and use a recording system taught to him by the heralds of Tashal. As a gift of thanks, Iriel provides the Acorn King of Arms a warhorse every five years. Even after forty years, some heralds remain unhappy that their record system is used by a commoner to record the birth and death of mere beasts.</p>\n<p>In addition to his many other duties, Iriel is a commoner and verderer of Tarwyn. He uses this office to act as a pony broker for many of the commoners. Although Iriel delegates many of his duties to Erdar, for the past two years all aspects of his duties as commoner and verderer have been carried out by his daughter Hylda. Hylda is tall, flat-chested, and gangling with light brown hair and a long, narrow nose. She is often mistaken for a boy, something which has only recently started to bother her.

Consisting of only 49 households, plus the imposing keep, Jedes lies in the south western edge of Oselshire.

the Scenes</h2>\n<p>Many of the scenes depict multi-level buildings, in particular the keep (which has 9 levels).  In many cases, multiple levels have been included in each scene, to reduce the number of scenes that must be managed.  For each level of each building, map markers have been used to provide details on that particular location.</p>\n<p>The main Jedes village map is also on a scene by itself.  It comtains map markers for all the various residences and shops throughout the village.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p>Some journal entries contain images within the text; where this is

{"_id":"pySYUhdfwNUoCBSh","name":"Jedes Horse Fair and Tourney","content":"<h1>Jedes Horse Fair and Tourney</h1>\n<div>\n<p><img src=\"modules/hm-loc-jedes/assets/images/horse-fair.webp\" width=\"297\" height=\"228\" /></p>\n<p>The Jedes Horse Fair and Tourney takes place from 25 to 30 Kelen, during which time the keep is overrun with visitors. For a short time, Jedes is transformed from a quiet backwater into a bustling centre of trade.</p>\n<h2>The Horse Fair</h2>\n<p>Jedes is justly famous for its annual horse fair. For centuries horses have grazed on the fertile lands of the Kald River valley, and wild horses still roam in the forests of Asolade. Many are pure Chelni ponies, though there has been some interbreeding with Hodiri and imported breeds. Chelni tribesmen regard Asolade horses as impure.</p>\n<p>The Jedes Horse Fair is the largest of its kind in Kaldor and attracts top breeders from across the kingdom. Although much horseflesh is traded at the great Tashal fair, the best is found at Jedes, from donkeys and mules to the finest steeds. Everything from palfreys to hackneys, sumpters to warhorses, farm horses to unbroken colts is available at the fair.</p>\n<p>Demand outstrips supply; this is the driving force behind the horse trade. An unusually high percentage of Jedes steeds are grey or white, the most sought-after colours among the Kaldoric nobility, who are the largest market for Asolade ostlers. In addition, most horses live short, hard lives; many nobles see horses of lower value as expendable, and bad harvests, war, poor veterinary care, and pestilence also take their toll. Good-quality horseflesh, therefore, can fetch high prices.</p>\n<p>Horse dealers congregate at Jedes days before the start of the fair. The fairground fills with fences and pens as horses are herded from across the hundred, and much farther afield, to be put up for auction to the large numbers of nobility or their agents who usually attend. Huge quantities of oats and hay are carted onto the grounds to feed the beasts, and enterprising farmers bring extra grain for sale. Despite the obvious opportunity, horse theft is rare; contingents of armed men and forbidding penalties discourage most wouldbe thieves.</p>\n<p>By law, sales of horses must occur at the fair and must be witnessed. In fact, it is illegal to buy, sell, or trade horses anywhere in Asolade Hundred during the months of Peonu, Kelen, and Nolus, apart from during the fair. Draught horses and other less expensive cart horses, donkeys, and mules are auctioned off first, saving the riding horses and quality warhorses for the last days of the fair. This gives prospective buyers good opportunity to examine and admire the beasts. Gradually the herds are winnowed, leaving only a few poor specimens. The buyer has a thirty-day period of grace after any sale: if at any time during the thirty days the horse shows symptoms of any sickness or displays any untoward behaviour, the seller must take it back. This can be the cause of many disputes, which in Asolade are decided by the Verderers’ Court. This is a lucrative source of income for the verderers.</p>\n<p>While horse trading is always the main event, the fair attracts merchants of all sorts. Food and drink in copious quantities are offered for sale. Entertainers, cutpurses, and prostitutes roam the fairground, each engaging visitors in the manner best suited to their occupations, with a mind to filling their own purses. Ostlers display their tack and saddlery, and noble visitors can spend huge sums on riding gear. Local merchants also sell cattle, hides, sausages, dried fish, furs, and the local strong, hard Asolade cheese. Asolade nobles and freemen buy many imported luxury items, such as fine dyed cloth, soaps, perfumes and scented candles.</p>\n<p>The horse fair was first held by Sir Dagrath of Dysarion, and many Asolade locals still refer to it as Dagrath’s Fair. It has been held annually since 430, with the exception of the years 603 to 605, after the removal of Clan Dysarion. In 679 Earl Scina Dariune introduced a tourney to the fair as a backdrop to the initial reconciliatory meeting between Torastra and Miginath. The added attraction of the tournament has since served to draw additional nobles to the fair. Depending upon his health, King Miginath and his court try to time their annual visit to coincide with the fair. During this time, the great hall is full of knights, squires, and their retinues.</p>\n<h2>The Tourney</h2>\n<p>The tourney consists of several events over the six days of the fair. It opens at noon on the 25th with an archery contest. This is open only to freemen, which severely restricts the number of entrants, but with thirteen families of yeomen archers within the hundred, competition for the 60d prize is always fierce.</p>\n<p>The archery contest is followed by the inter-village tug-of-war, which brings the peasants of the hundred to Jedes in vast numbers. Each village in the hundred, including the monks of Bromeleon, enter one team. The only settlement unrepresented is the leper colony at Poynter. Last year’s final, between the monks and their neighbours, the miners of Orofal, was an epic struggle. The miners won.</p>\n<p>The joust takes place from the 26th to the 28th. It is a popular contest and is becoming more so, as over the last six years a tradition has been established of awarding the winner a white palfrey bred by Iriel of Haskew. The master ostler, well-known for the quality of his warhorses, breeds riding horses famous for their speed and light colouring. The victor of the joust also has his blazon hung on the west wall of the great hall until the following year’s tournament.</p>\n<p>The melee takes place on 29 Kelen. Contestants join one of two sides, red or white, by drawing a scarf from a box. Heralds note the names and colour of all participants. Swapping scarves is forbidden.</p>\n<p>The last day of the tourney consists of four horse races, which attract a huge amount of gambling. Sir Shernath believes in the maxim “don’t outlaw it, tax it”. The year after his appointment, the constable decreed that all gambling must be licensed. He now issues licenses at 10s (120d) per person to any bookmakers. Any unlicensed bookmakers are fined £1 (240d). These gambling licenses make a huge profit for the constable.</p>\n<p>Each race starts outside the Fallen Tower Inn and finishes at “Ostler’s Well” (the well north of Iriel of Haskew’s premises (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.bCum4eajpSVcRN0R]{Ostler Iriel of Haskew})). The first two races cover almost two full circuits of the tourney green, a total distance of 10 furlongs. The third race is three circuits, 15 furlongs, and the fourth is almost four circuits, 20 furlongs. The first race is for nobles only; the others are open to all. The nobility rarely participate in the open races, but many nobles sponsor a rider. Many members of the Jedes light horse squadron, as well as several yeomen and ostlers, take part in the open races. If someone not already a member of the light horse squadron proves to be an exceptional rider, they are likely to be invited to join the squadron.</p>\n</div>","img":"modules/hm-loc-jedes/assets/images/horse-fair.webp","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gJdONrabJ2SyRfYT":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":600000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.w2OySy5wm2ZsnHXy"}}}

The original building was little more than a three-storey fortified stone manor house built on low ground just east of where Whittle Brook enters the Kald. All trace of this building is now lost as over the last four centuries the keep has been altered, expanded, and substantially improved.</p>\n<p>Fierth the Usurper used Jedes as a base of operations during the Kaldoric Civil War. In 375, he had a moat cut across the two sides of the keep not already protected by water. A primitive drawbridge was also constructed. In 377, after the death of Aidrik II, Fierth granted the keep to one of his most trusted supporters, Travess of Sirv, a vicious, one-eyed mercenary. Unfortunately, while Travess was an excellent butcher of men, he was an incompetent lord; for the next thirty years, the keep was very poorly maintained.</p>\n<p>In 407, within a year of the Restoration, Clan Sirv was evicted from Jedes, and for the next two decades the keep was the official residence of the Sheriff of Oselshire. As the king’s representative in former rebel territory, the sheriff spent a considerable sum improving the keep’s defences. He had the walls repaired and made thicker and a fourth storey added. He rounded up and executed the few surviving supporters of Fierth, many of whom had turned to banditry. To impress on the locals that royal justice was established, the bandits’ corpses were hung in seven gibbets erected as league markers on the road from Jedes to the village of Nicomen. Since then the road has been known as the Gibbet Trail.</p>\n<p>Over the following years the Pagaelin south of the Osel River became increasingly bold and began raiding southern Kaldor. In 425, in response to these incursions, King Aidrik IV ordered a new keep be built at Hutop, which upon completion five years later became the new seat of the office of sheriff. Jedes meanwhile was granted to Sir Dagrath of Dysarion, along with the title Baron of Asolade. (Sir Dagrath was rumoured to be an illegitimate son of the king.) Jedes remained in the hands of Clan Dysarion for almost 200 years.</p>\n<p>When King Iemald died, in 599, Hegran of Dysarion was one of the fifteen claimants to the throne. By 602 “King” Hegran and his few remaining followers were besieged in Jedes by forces under the command of Sir Dalman Dariune, the younger brother of the Earl of Balim. Sir Dalman noticed that the north-east corner of the sixtyfoot square keep had been partially undermined by the Kald River. He ordered six miners to head downstream in a boat under cover of darkness. The miners landed and clambered into the undercut, which was barely deep enough to shelter them from the forces on the battlements. Once in place they began working to further undermine the keep.</p>\n<p>Twice sorties were sent from the keep to stop the digging, but both times the besieging forces drove them back. For three days the miners dug, while supplies were rowed to them at night. On the second day a fierce storm broke over Jedes, and torrential rain put the miners at risk of flooding, but they worked on, and the following day the storm passed on up the Kald valley.</p>\n<p>On the morning of the fourth day, cracks began to appear in the keep. Hegran realised that his position was hopeless and sent a herald to negotiate a surrender. While the talks were underway, however, the river began to rise rapidly. The undercut, now considerably larger and still holding the miners, flooded. All six men were swept away; four of them drowned, Sir Dalman’s men rescued one, and the last miner arrived back at Jedes almost two days later, having washed ashore, battered and barely breathing, at Chewintin.</p>\n<p>The miner’s work, combined with the flood waters, seriously weakened the north-east corner of the tower. As Hegran’s herald continued with the negotiations, the entire rear wall of the keep fell away into the river, bringing down several floors and the roof with it. Many of the keep’s defenders tumbled into the swollen river and drowned. Hegran, however, survived. The siege was ended quickly and spectacularly.</p>\n<p>In 603, the civil war was finally over. Haldan the Elder formally stripped the few surviving members of Clan Dysarion of all lands and banished them. He then granted Jedes to “those loyal servants of the House of Elendsa, Clan Dariune”. As part of their reward, the Dariunes were granted royal approval to repair and improve the ruined keep “for the better defence of the realm”—at their own expense. The clan, flush with booty from the war, were pleased with this situation and spent considerable sums of money upgrading the keep. A mason was hired and piles driven into the riverbed. By 625 the keep had taken on its current form, a tall D-shaped tower. In the same year, the wharf was built to service goods regularly passed upriver, mainly to Tashal and Kiban. For the next fifty years Jedes returned to relative obscurity, an out-of-the-way backwater famous only for its annual horse fair. Appointing a constable to manage the estate, Clan Dariune visited the keep only occasionally in summer months.</p>\n<p>King Miginath is known to be fond of Jedes; he spends more time visiting it (at the earl’s expense) than any other fief except Olokand. During the years Miginath spent in Cherafir as prince-in-exile, Earl Scina Dariune, father of the current earl, took steps to bring about a rapprochement between the prince and his father. Princess Kethele, wife to Earl Scina and sister of King Torastra, was instrumental in arranging meetings between her brother and her nephew. Jedes was chosen as the place of the first meeting between father and son for years, in 679. The meeting went well; King Torastra was apparently much taken with a young noblewoman, one of several members of Clan Kaphin in Miginath’s retinue.</p>\n<p>For the next three years the prince made at least one visit per year to Jedes to meet his father. In 682, after the death of Prince Haldan, Torastra allowed Miginath to remain in Kaldor. The frequent royal visits, with retinues in train, were quite a strain on the earl’s hospitality, but he bore it without complaint, working for long-term political ends. The death of Haldan proved the wisdom of this politicking.</p>\n<p>After their reconciliation, Miginath and his father continued to use Jedes as a meeting place on many occasions. The king remains fond of “the Keep in the Kald” and visits as often as possible.</p>\n<h2>Politics</h2>\n<p>Jedes is a very small market town. It is, however, approximately twice the size of the surrounding manors and provides many guild services not available anywhere else within a day’s walk. Sir Shernath has improved the roads to Kolorn and Hutop.</p>\n<p>The town, and to a great extent Asolade Hundred, is run by the decree of the constable. As Jedes is used to ship much of the ore from the two mines in the hundred, the constable can also exert some influence over the Miner’s Guild. Jedes benefits from extra toll revenues from the lead and copper mines, and the guild has a contract with Sir Shernath to provide guards.</p>\n<p>The Pelnala of Bromeleon Abbey takes little interest in secular affairs, while the Bailiff of the Hundred, Sir Arrys Maradyne [<a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/settlements/asolade-hundred/\">Asolade Hundred</a> p72], seems happy to do even less than his predecessor, Sir Boroman Maradyne. This leaves the constable in effective control.</p>\n<h2>Government</h2>\n<p>For many years Earl Troda Dariune has known that he can rely on prompt delivery of his feudal dues from his constable. To try to anticipate any problems, once each month, at Yaelah, the constable holds a feast at the keep, after which he discusses news, problems, and policies with his appointed advisors. These advisors, “the constable’s council”, are an eclectic group. Sir Shernath values aptitude and efficiency over birth and right and, to the annoyance of some local nobles, makes his appointments accordingly.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of 720, the constable’s council consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.Fe3bC4oPMid9LkFY]{NPC: Lady Helarn Poulty, Chancellor of the Keep} Lady Helarn has lived in Asolade Hundred for all of her 56 years and is known and trusted by almost all of the noble families. She voices the concerns of the local nobility.</li>\n<li>Coner of Kleve (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.sClGLD5tFX9k9OE8]{Mercantyler Coner of Kleve}) is the most experienced mercantyler in the hundred and is chairman of the hundred branch of the Mangai. Coner speaks for the guildsmen of the hundred.</li>\n<li>Iriel of Haskew (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.bCum4eajpSVcRN0R]{Ostler Iriel of Haskew}) is Guildmaster Ostler of Eastern Hârn. His influence spreads far beyond Asolade. The Ostler’s Guild is the most important guild in the hundred; Iriel’s place on the council acknowledges this fact.</li>\n<li>Hamis of Guinas (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.L0AJBusWW3EjQuAx]{Chapel of Peoni - Reslava Hamis of Guinas}) is the local priest of Peoni. Hamis is a gossip and is not as discrete with his parishioners’ secrets as he should be, especially after a few cups of the constable’s finest perry.</li>\n<li>Anle of Ornelt (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.fe9WZ8ty9OQyp37Y]{Fisherwoman Anle of Ornelt}) is a local fisherwoman and coraclemaker. She ostensibly represents the unguilded freemen. In fact, Anle is naively honest and often asks awkward questions of the others, a trait that the constable appreciates.</li>\n<li>Peser of Luren (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.NgjQveAH5DMBk23j]{Reeve Peser of Luren}) is reeve of Jedes village. An unfree farmer, Peser is an excellent judge of the views of the local peasantry. In addition, his predictions of the year’s likely harvest are usually very accurate. Peser’s opinions allow Sir Shernath to judge likely incomes from the surrounding fiefs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regardless of their status, the advisory council are expected to make their case, whether or not Sir Shernath agrees with their viewpoint.</p>\n<h2>Commoners of Tarwyn</h2>\n<p>Uniquely among royal forests, a number of individuals have grazing rights within the forests of Asolade Hundred. These thirty-seven named individuals are the Commoners of Tarwyn, all of whom are resident within the hundred. Royal foresters do not patrol within Asolade; the commoners carry out this duty, appointing five Agisters of Tarwyn.</p>\n<p>For more details on the commoners, their history, organisation, and rights, see <a href=\"https://www.lythia.com/harnworld/settlements/asolade-hundred/\">Asolade Hundred</a> [pp2-3, 56].</p>\n<h2>Religion</h2>\n<p>As is the case throughout most of Kaldor, temples of Peoni and Larani in Jedes are tax-exempt, though the are only thing in the village resembling a temple is a small Peonian chapel. The main place of Peonian worship trade for residents of Jedes, and the hundred, is the abbey at Bromeleon. Most locals attend at least one service a cheese, month there.</p>\n<p>The only representatives of the church of Larani in Jedes are the keep’s chaplain, one of only three matakea in the hundred, and his acolytes.</p>\n<p>Worship of Halea and Ilvîr is discouraged, but not prohibited. There are only two Haleans in Jedes: the metalsmith Alen of Asane and the mercantyler Cyrael of Urnelt. They keep their religion to themselves. The worship of Ilvîr is restricted to a few individuals in some of the more remote villages.</p>\n<p>Worship of Agrik, Morgath, and Naveh is punishable by death.</p>\n<h3>Saint Bromel’s Fast</h3>\n<p>The proximity of Bromeleon Abbey, and the shrine to St. Bromel there, is beneficial to Jedes. St. Bromel’s Fast, a celebration of the saint’s life, takes place on 15 Savor, drawing devout Peonians from all over Kaldor. Most of these pilgrims travel through Jedes to visit the holy site, often travelling by barge from Tashal, Kiban, and even Olokand. Although the pilgrims spend little on the journey to Bromeleon, on their return, the fast over, many buy food, perry, and keepsakes.</p>\n<h2>Economics</h2>\n<p>Jedes market is held four times a month, on the 4th, 12th, 20th, and 27th. Most local guildsmen and many serfs bring produce to sell. Coner of Cleve (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.sClGLD5tFX9k9OE8]{Mercantyler Coner of Kleve}), as chairman of the Mangai, is theoretically in charge of the market. However, his business interests often take him away and he subcontracts the duties to Cyrael of Urnelt (@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.hGlNssrjEs9bE4jA]{Mercantyler Cyrael of Urnelt}).</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.1477%\"><caption>Taxes</caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.8208%\">Property Tax (Residential)</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.4941%\">6%/annum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.8208%\">Property Tax (Business)</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.4941%\">4%/annum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.8208%\">Hawking Fee</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.4941%\">8% value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.8208%\">Bonding Fee</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.4941%\">2% value/month</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:21.8208%\">Wharfage</td>\n<td style=\"width:66.4941%\">3f/ft/day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Imports and Exports</h3>\n<p>Jedes, like the surrounding settlements in Asolade, is fertile farmland. Jedes is the only settlement with a wharf. As the majority of linen and good-quality wool imported by barge, as are all metals other than copper and lead, Jedes market is the focus for almost all within the hundred. Local exports of grain (including mustard seeds, flour, and oil), the local tarwyn and copper and lead from the local mines are all transported to Jedes for export by barge up the Kald.</p>\n<h2>Jedes Keep</h2>\n<p>The tall and imposing Jedes Keep often hosts important visitors. Earl Troda visits at least once a year to inspect his southern holdings. He often brings a large retinue of knights from his household, looking for quality warhorses. He usually times his visit for the annual horse fair, though in the last few years the pressures of his work as Exchequer Royal have delayed his arrival.</p>\n<p>King Miginath also likes to return to Jedes. As the king has aged, these visits have become less frequent, but Sir Shernath has been sent word that the king intends to visit this year. Sir Shernath is concerned that the king will be unable to manage the stairs to his usual room. He has sent a long, carefully worded letter to Princess Meliem, the Lord High Chamberlain, in an attempt to ensure that he can accommodate the king’s needs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.LGQL9IVxNnxCFTM5]{The Keep}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.6lCQyaK8UY55Bkzf]{The Castle Field}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Additional Information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.ZAdISUCfa8AaNC0o]{Guilds}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.EwpheWa4iUeepysS]{Merchant Quality Ratings}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.pySYUhdfwNUoCBSh]{Jedes Horse Fair and Tourney}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[hm-loc-jedes.journals.QVUhr7Z5Z4l7WqAB]{Military}</li>\n</ul>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"gJdONrabJ2SyRfYT":3},"flags":{"entityorder":{"order":200000},"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.HCc8PHp3TXsquncb"}}}
