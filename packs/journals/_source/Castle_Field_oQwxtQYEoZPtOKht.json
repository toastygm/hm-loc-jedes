This is more than the fourteen stalls can hold, so the stables are always full and busy. A half-squadron of light horse regularly patrol the hundred, keeping five or six horses away for three days at a time and easing the pressure on the stables. The light horse squadron are responsible for their own mounts, which also reduces Ferot’s otherwise heavy workload. The horses are put out to pasture each morning.</p>\n<p>The stable lass, brown-haired, 17-year-old Jaythe of Tannis, sleeps in the loft. Aelstor Kaphin often pays her visits at night.</p>",
