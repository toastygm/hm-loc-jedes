At its highest point it stands some 100 feet above the river, commanding outstanding views of the surrounding countryside.</p>\n<p>When the keep was repaired, between 605 and 625, Clan Dariune had the collapsed rear wall rebuilt into a semi-circle. The mason overseeing the reconstruction, Egbert of Noss, convinced the earl that the original keep’s rectangular shape had contributed to its collapse once undermined by the river. Egbert had a temporary dam erected, the water pumped out, and the river gravel excavated down to bedrock. The rear wall of the keep now stands on solid rock.</p>\n<p>The main entrance is via a drawbridge over a narrow moat, which cuts across a man-made slope leading up to the keep. This entrance is further protected by a set of double doors, a corridor through the wall, and another iron-bound and barred set of doors. A second, smaller postern door, which only the servants use, is accessed via a narrow removable wooden bridge. From dawn to dusk one guard always patrols between the two doors.</p>\n<p>Plans to add a portcullis have been drawn up. The portcullis, and alterations to the postern gate, could be implemented under the written instructions of Earl Dariune “at the discretion of the constable, in the event of any future civil unrest”.</p>\n<ul style=\"clear:left\">\n<li><strong>Basement</strong>\n<ul style=\"clear:left\">\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.MfX8vNGfgcU3Q88w]{[K0a] Cellar}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.q1tAWl1UBvWZMfKw]{[K0b] Oubliette}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ground Floor</strong> (entrance to the Keep)\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.qEJ66c3mHNdcjgK8]{[KGa] Small Hall}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.dn74u5wnr27Dd9xe]{[KGb] Barracks}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.6QwANGpFBLZpufHG]{[KGc] Kitchen}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.M6thuqHYdaA7HD9o]{[K1] The Great Hall}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.YfjsA9B1NNK5FN5W]{[K2] Ladies’ Gallery and Solar}</li>\n<li><strong>Third Floor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.2f93A4bIvvnZJEFL]{[K31] The Upper Hall}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.ngojMxMuYxvf3oIz]{[K32] The Steward and the Herald}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.iJVj1iYcGhYhIUBQ]{[K33] The Chancellor}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.YtyoHd3mx1Raasuz]{[K34] The Chaplain}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.7ny2OEBFQt9DxzBw]{[K35] The Chamberlain}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fourth Floor</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.NxcZTTWUFMaW0AjB]{[K41] The Constable}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.CXriaZydBKhSMRXF]{[K42] The Royal Chamber}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.zQr8JOwmpy3yLdJF]{[K43] The Chapel}</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.wRACXAvN6azy3dsD.JournalEntryPage.nKvUsoXOYI3g7tU1]{[K5] Roof and Towers}</li>\n</ul>",
