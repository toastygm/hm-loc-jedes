He often enquires as to the health of his birds. As a consequence Yma can often be seen in conversation with the constable. This sets her apart from the other village children. Yma is the only unfree resident of Jedes allowed the run of the keep. Neither the guards nor the servants ever stop or question her. If she wishes to speak to the constable, he will make time for her; she is intelligent enough not to interrupt any important discussions, especially between nobles.</p>\n<p>All of the geese have had their wings clipped. They are fiercely territorial and are kept in the goose house when important visitors are expected. Yma is tasked with keeping the flock in order and getting them back into the yard each night, a job she has been carrying out successfully for three years. Yma is an excellent swimmer and sometimes swims across the Kald to collect a wayward bird. She used to swim naked, but as she is maturing her father has insisted that she be clothed; she does not always obey. Yma can usually be found in the vicinity of the keep, her willow goose wand in her hands.</p>",

Lady Jenya is friendly, caring, and fond of young children, though she has a sharp tongue and occasionally a fiery temper. She is 5’4”, more stocky than she was in her youth, and her once vivid red hair is beginning to grey. Nevertheless, the lady of the keep remains fit and active.</p>\n<p>Sir Shernath and Lady Jenya have two sons. The eldest, Jannath, was sent at age 10 to study heraldry in the Enclave of the Holy Oak. Now 16, he is a squire in the household of Earl Troda. Jannath is besotted with Merela, the 14-year-old daughter of Princess Cheselyne, and when in Tashal he neglects his duties to be with her. His parents have recently been made aware of this. Lady Jenya regards Merela as a scheming minx, as dangerous as her mother, and worries that Jannath is being led astray. She intends to pay her eldest son a visit.</p>\n<p>The second son, Sumael, 13, is a squire at Bory, the manor of his mother’s family. Lady Jenya visits him as often as she can.

He reputedly shows no favours, but appoints the best man, or woman, to the job. Many local clans would, however, dispute this, as they have seen lucrative posts handed to relatives of the constable and his wife. Nevertheless, incompetence will usually lead to swift dismissal. Sir Shernath delivers his feudal dues, and often more, on time, keeps the local yeomen well-trained, and has improved the Kolorn and Hutop roads.

The earl confides in his friend and can rely on him to give an honest opinion, regardless of the earl’s feelings. While the men never argue, they are often blunt to the point of rudeness. Some of Earl Troda’s vassal’s, after witnessing such discussions, assume Sir Shernath’s position is less secure than it actually is.</p>\n<p>In addition to managing the earl’s lands in Asolade, Sir Shernath is often given other tasks. He is currently working on an estimate of expected revenues from Kyg, as the earl is concerned about his income from that part of his holdings. Sir Shernath has been sent copies of the revenues and receipts that the Constable of Kyg sent to Kiban. He suspects that his liege is being swindled, but as yet lacks any proof. He intends to send a small group of trusted investigators to Kyg.</p>",

He is well aware of his shortcomings and is extremely grateful to his sister and beloved wife.</p>\n<p>Sir Tamys is 5’7” and has the characteristic Poulty red hair, though it is thinning. He is untidy and forgetful, often muttering under his breath the names or details he must remember. The chamberlain is usually the first noble to meet any visitors. Making a good impression on Sir Tamys can make a huge difference to how visitors are introduced into the constable’s presence.</p>",

Unlike many young men his age, he is at ease in the company of women of all ages. At any social gathering he is surrounded by all the eligible young ladies of the hundred; Aelstor is also popular with the servant-girls. As a consequence, most of the local squires dislike him. His closest friend is Eldaen Katair, squire to Sir Jarrak Vaen, Lord of Feneven.</p>",

He has thick, greasy black hair and is now burly rather than fat. Karison is intensely competitive. He and his good friend Sumael Mirdarne keep a running score of their achievements. Karison is undoubtedly the physically stronger and the better horseman. Sumael is more agile, a better archer, and a much faster swimmer. With sword and shield the boys are evenly matched.</p>",
