# HârnWorld Location Module: Jedes Keep

Jedes keep is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. It is designed to depict
the Jedes keep in the kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the
[HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy setting; however, this keep
and village could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic, with the exception of Actors.
Detailed descriptions of the actors has been provided in journal entries to facilitate
conversion to other game systems.

Jedes is the largest settlement in Asolade Hundred. Consisting of only 49 households,
plus the imposing keep, Jedes lies in the south western edge of Oselshire. This module
details all of the households. This module includes interior plans of the keep, its
outbuildings, and the inn; plus illustrations by Richard Luschek and Juha Makkonen.

Jedes is remote from the politics of central Kaldor. With the majority of settlements run
by a constable for the Earl of Balim, this is one of the Earl’s most important holdings.
It is also a favourite of King Miginath.

Jedes is not a rough frontier settlement, but the last remnant of the ancient Kingdom of
Tarwyn. A land of fertile fields, fat cattle, and sturdy forest ponies, Jedes and the
region is a renowned centre of horse breeding.
